When a function is called, it may perform some computation and then produce a result, which it can then return to the caller. This return value can be used by the calling code for further computation, assignment to variables, or any other purpose.\n",

    ">>Purpose of the try clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "The try clause is used to wrap the code that might raise an exception or an error.\n",
    "Its purpose is to execute the code inside it and monitor for any exceptions that might occur during execution.\n",
    "If an exception occurs within the try block, Python immediately stops executing the code inside the try block and jumps to the appropriate except block (if one exists) to handle the exception.\n",
    "If no exception occurs, the code inside the try block is executed without interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>Purpose of the except clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "The except clause follows the try clause and specifies one or more exception types that it can catch and handle.\n",
    "Its purpose is to define the code that should be executed if a specific type of exception occurs within the associated try block.\n",
    "When an exception occurs in the try block, Python checks whether there's a matching except block for that type of exception.\n",
    "If a matching except block is found, Python executes the code inside that block to handle the exception.\n",
    "If no matching except block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack, potentially causing the program to terminate if it's not caught elsewhere.\n",
    "In summary, the try clause is used to wrap the code that might raise an exception, and the except clause is used to define how to handle specific types of exceptions that might occur within the try block. Together, they allow you to gracefully handle errors and prevent your program from crashing."
